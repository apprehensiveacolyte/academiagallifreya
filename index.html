    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Greetings to members of the Gallifreyan Tradition and the curious.<br>
I go by the names Jade, Lirija, and Void. My pronouns are the/them/their.<br>
I am a Patrician of the Council and a moderator for this site.</p>
<p>For me, GT was a project to work on with a person that I admired highly. This has grown into a new and unique culture, has assisted in discovers of many aspects of existence, including several parts of my own life, and has the promise to create an accessible, sustainable, and welcoming future.
I do hope that GT can assist others in making discoveries about the universe and themselves, helping them to find the best path for themselves to become what they wish to be. I will be teaching methods of solution creating and refining, part of this will include conflict resolution. Aspects of this will also be accessibility and sustainability, as they are important. Such methods can assist in decision making, and solving problems at all levels, from a conflict between two people, personal struggles, societal issues, to innovation.
I will also be teaching Collective Gallifreyan, a conlang created to be a functional (i.e. useable for communication) version of circular gallifreyan.</p>
<p>I wish for GT to be a welcoming place, and I will attempt to resolve any conflicts or issues that are brought to my attention. I would prefer to know of a difficult problem than to be blissfully unaware, typically the longer a problem goes on, the greater it becomes. I am also happy to answer any and all questions, regardless of subject.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to the Gallifreyan Tradition Society and the Academy. I am Patrician Shilo Greenwood (they/them), a Councillor and site moderator here at the GT Academy.</p>

<p>Community is most important part of GT to me. We are a diverse group of people who have a lot to learn from each other. It is this diversity in identity, skill sets and world views alongside acceptance that makes us strong. The Gallifreyan Tradition has helped me find a community where I feel accepted and safe, and this is something I hope all of the incoming members find as well.</p>

<p>If there is anything I can help you with as time goes on, feel free to ask.</p>
